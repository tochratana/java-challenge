Write a method called printNumberInWord. The method has one parameter number which is the whole number. The method needs to print "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", ... "NINE", "OTHER" if the int parameter number is 0, 1, 2, .... 9 or other for any other number including negative numbers. You can use if-else statement or switch statement whatever is easier for you.

Sum Odd
Write a method called isOdd with an int parameter and call it number. The method needs to return a boolean.

Check that number is > 0, if it is not return false.

If number is odd return true, otherwise return false.

Write a second method called sumOdd that has 2 int parameters start and end, which represent a range of numbers.

The method should use a for loop to sum all odd numbers in that range including the end and return the sum.

It should call the method isOdd to check if each number is odd.

The parameter end needs to be greater than or equal to start and both start and end parameters have to be greater than 0.

If those conditions are not satisfied return -1 from the method to indicate invalid input.
## 6. Number Palindrome
Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.

The method needs to return a boolean.

It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
